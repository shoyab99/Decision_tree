Project Title:
Cardiovascular Risk Prediction using Decision Trees
Objective:
The project aims to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular health risks based on a variety of factors such as age, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, blood pressure, and more. The prediction is done using machine learning algorithms, specifically the Decision Tree Classifier.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related features including:
Demographic data: Gender, age, education.
Health factors: Smoking status, cigarettes per day, BMI, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels.
Medical history: History of stroke, hypertension, diabetes.
Target Variable: Gender (male or female).
Tools and Technologies:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Your Role:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing data by removing rows with null values.
Transformed categorical variables where necessary (e.g., gender, smoking status).
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.
Feature Selection & Engineering:

Selected relevant features like age, BMI, cholesterol, and smoking habits to be used for prediction.
Created training and test datasets using train_test_split.
Model Building & Training:

Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of individuals being male based on the datasetâ€™s features.
Optimized the model using hyperparameters and validated the model with test data.
Performance Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 61.8%.
Identified areas of improvement, such as using other machine learning models for better accuracy.
Data Visualization:

Visualized data distributions and relationships using count plots, box plots, and other graphical methods to provide insights into patterns within the data.
